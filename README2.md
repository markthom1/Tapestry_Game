# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Unit Unit 1 Project: Create a Game

## Overview

For the Unit 1 Project, let's start out with something fun â€” a game!  This will give you a chance to be creative and work through tough programming challenges.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you throughout the process and helping as you go.

<br>

## Technical Requirements
Your app must:

- Render a game in the browser.
- Include logic for winning, and visually indicate which player has won.
- Include separate HTML/CSS /JavaScript files.
- Stick with the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Use JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation.
- Be deployed on GitHub Pages and accessible online.
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS, adhering to best practices.

<br>

## Necessary Deliverables

- A working game, built by you, hosted on GitHub Pages.
- A Git repository, hosted on GitHub, that includes a link to your hosted game and frequent commits dating back to the beginning of the project.
- Links to or pics of Wireframes. These can be hand drawn or online (e.g. - https://wireframe.cc/)
- 10 User stories at a minimum
- A Trello board with 10 at least cards
- A `README.md` file in your app repo with explanations of:
  - Technologies used.
  - Your process/approach.
  - Future features
  - Any bugs
  - Your biggest wins and challenges.
  - The game you chose.
  - The rules of the game.
  - Your process for turning that game into a web application (wireframes, blockers/issues that popped up).


<br>

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Break the project down** into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
- **Use your development tools** (`console.log`, inspector, alert statements, etc.) to debug and solve problems.
- **Work through the lessons in class** and ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something. You can always revert to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you'll be getting into.

Don't be afraid to write code you know you'll have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc.) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you're trying to figure out how to change some text when the game ends but you haven't solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that scenario in the meantime.

>Things To Avoid:

>- Don't create a game that includes violence, weapons, or gore.
>- Don't create a game that may offend your fellow associates or alienate those with specific religious, political, or philosophical views.
>- Don't overthink it

## Project Timeline

### Monday 8/21

- **9am** - Project specs will be delivered

- **12pm** -  Stand-up: quick project pitch to your squad leader. This pitch should answer the following questions:
  - What is your game idea?
  - What technologies will you need to make the game function?
  
 - **4:30pm** - [Exit Ticket](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/IFMKDC) with the following...
 
  - __What topic(s) did you cover in class today?__: Please give a summary of what you accomplished today.
  - __What were your two biggest takeaways from today's lessons and activities?__: Please let us know what feature you're gonna work on next/goals for tomorrow.
  - __What questions do you still have about the content?__: Any roadblocks?

- **By end of day** - You should have accomplished the following:
	
	- Create wireframes
	- Create user stories
	- Create a repo on your **personal** GitHub profile. This is so when you deploy to GitHub pages your app will be accessible outside of `visigoth`
	- Create your project folder structure

<br>

## Potential Project Ideas

- Blackjack
	- Make a one-player game in which people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

- Self-Scoring Trivia
	- Test your knowledge and wits. Guess the answers to trivia questions, and have the computer tell you how right (or wrong) you are!
- Hangman
- Tower of Hanoi
- Simon
- Solitaire
- Minesweeper
- Duck Hunt
- Tic Tac Toe
- Tetris
- Battleship
- Sudoku
- Connect Four

<br>

## Potential Bonuses

- Incorporate AI
- Add the ability to play on multiple devices simultaneously
- Make your game optimized for mobile fist
- Keep score for multiple games (best of 10, etc)
- Persist the high scores (via firebase, database, local storage)
- Create an "arcade" of multiple games
- Scale up the game (e.g. - Tic Tac Toe 4X4)

<br>
 

## Useful Resources
- MDN JavaScript Docs _(a great reference for all things plain vanilla JavaScript)_
- jQuery Docs _(if you're using jQuery)_
- GitHub Pages _(for hosting your game)_

## Project Feedback + Evaluation
- **Project Workflow:** Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs as detailed above? Did you use source control as expected for this phase of the course?
- **Technical Requirements:** Did you deliver a project that met all of the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build an asset that was reasonably complex?
- **Creativity:** Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?
- **Code Quality:** Did you follow the code style guidance and best practices covered in class for elements such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code like your instructors have in class?
- **Deployment:** Did you deploy your application to a public URL using GitHub Pages?
